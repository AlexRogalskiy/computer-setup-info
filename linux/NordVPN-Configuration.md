# Nord VPN Documentation on Debian, Ubuntu, Elementary OS, and Linux Mint
## Installation
The *NordVPN* native application is the recommended option for connecting to NordVPN servers on your Linux device. We designed it with your experience in mind, giving easy access to features such as CyberSec, auto-connect, and automated Kill Switch.

This tutorial explains how to download and install the NordVPN app, log in, and connect to our servers. You can also find an explanation of various settings.
 

1. Download the NordVPN Linux client from our [Downloads](https://nordvpn.com/download/linux) page or click on [this](https://repo.nordvpn.com/deb/nordvpn/debian/pool/main/nordvpn-release_1.0.0_all.deb) direct link.

Alternatively, you can use this command and proceed straight to step 3:

`sudo wget -qnc https://repo.nordvpn.com/deb/nordvpn/debian/pool/main/nordvpn-release_1.0.0_all.deb`

2. Open Terminal and run the following command:

`sudo dpkg -i /pathToFile/nordvpn-release_1.0.0_all.deb`

Make sure to replace */pathToFile/* with the path to your Downloads folder (or other location where the NordVPN file was downloaded).

Example: `sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/nordvpn-release_1.0.0_all.deb`

You will be asked to enter your root password. Enter it, wait for the package installation to finish, and proceed to the next step.

3. Update the package list:

`sudo apt update` (or `sudo apt-get update`)

4. Install the NordVPN app:

`sudo apt install nordvpn` (or `sudo apt-get install nordvpn`)

5. Log in to your NordVPN account:

`nordvpn login`

6. Connect to a NordVPN server:

`nordvpn connect`

In case you get the GPG error (NO_PUBKEY), use the following command and repeat step 4:

`sudo wget https://repo.nordvpn.com/gpg/nordvpn_public.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add -`
